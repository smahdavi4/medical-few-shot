# Few-Shot Medical Image segmentation

This repository contains the code to my BS thesis. There are two directories as follows:
* `registration`: Contains the code to our approach.
*  `src`: Contains the implementations of other few-shot image segmentation papers, as well as some dataset utils.

Note that the VISCERAL Anatomy3 organ segmentation dataset is not open-source; hence a preprocessed version of the dataset is not provided.

A pdf report is avalable [here](http://smahdavi.com/files/medical-few-shot-v0.pdf).
